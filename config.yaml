# This is a minimal chaparral configuration.

# Storage Backend 
#
# The backend can be set here or using the CHAPARRAL_BACKEND environment
# variable.
#
# S3 example
# backend: s3://ocfl-bucket?region=us-west-2

# FS example
# backend: file:///data


# Upload path
#
# Set 'uploads' to a directory path (relative to the backend) where uploads will
# be stored. Note that storage root paths must not include or be included in
# this directory. The default value ("") disables uploads.
uploads: "uploads"

# Sorage Root config
#
# Multiple OCFL storage roots can be configured. Here the default storage root
# path is set to `ocfl-default` (relative to the backend). If the storage root
# doesn't exist, it will be created using values in `init`. Additional storage
# roots can be added, but they need to include a unique, non-empty `id` value.
roots:
- id: "main"
  path: "ocfl-default" # path relative to CHAPARRAL_BACKEND
  init:
    # if the storage doesn't exist it will be created with 
    # these optiosn
